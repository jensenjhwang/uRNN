Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks
===
This repository contains our implementation of unitary RNNs for pathological synthetic tasks and language modelling on the Penn Treebank dataset, as outlined in our [CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning Final Report](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/custom/15842215.pdf). Refer to the READMEs of the respective tasks for more information.
